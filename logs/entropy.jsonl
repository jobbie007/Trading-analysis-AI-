Overall Assessment:\nThe stock is in a strong uptrend but appears overbought, approaching key resistance levels near the 0.500 Fibonacci retracement at 226.30 and the calculated R2 level of 247.42. The RSI indicates some oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a pullback.\n\n## 2. Key Levels to Watch:\n- **Resistance:** R1 at 244.48, R2 at 247.42\n- **Support:** S1 at 238.87, S2 at 236.20, 0.382 Fibonacci level at 233.31\n\n## 3. Potential Trade Scenarios:\n### Bullish Scenario (Potential Buy):\nA breakout and hold above R1 at 244.48 could signal a continuation of the uptrend. Additionally, if the MACD crosses above its signal line, it would confirm bullish momentum.\n\n### Bearish Scenario (Potential Sell/Caution):\n- A break below the key support at the 0.382 Fibonacci level of 233.31 could indicate a deeper pullback.\n- If the RSI drops below 40 and MACD crosses below its signal line, it may signal weakening bullish momentum.\n\n```\n\nThis plan provides clear guidance on monitoring key levels and identifying potential trade setups based on both support/resistance and technical indicators.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 929}}}

Key Levels to Watch\n- **Resistance:** R1 (238.82), R2 (244.74)\n- **Support:** S1 (228.25), S2 (223.60), 0.382 Fibonacci level (205.38)\n\n## 3.
