Bitcoin and altcoins saw a sharp dip earlier this week as former U.S. President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Chinese imports , triggering short-term panic across commodities and risk assets. But within 48 hours, the crypto market made a remarkable recovery \u2014 signaling growing investor confidence in digital assets as a global hedge. From AI-powered tokens to community-led meme coins , traders are now shifting focus toward projects with strong fundamentals and high social momentum. Here\u2019s a look at the top trending cryptocurrencies and presales that analysts believe could outperform as the market stabilizes. Market Recap: Trump\u2019s Sanction Shock & Crypto\u2019s Swift Rebound On Monday, the Trump administration announced a new round of sanctions targeting Chinese tech and import goods , citing \u201cunfair market practices.\u201d The announcement triggered a global sell-off: The S&P 500 fell 2.4% for the period, Gold touching all time historic high , and Bitcoin briefly dropped below $110,000 before rebounding. By midweek, the crypto market cap recovered above $3.90 trillion , with strong inflows into DeFi, meme, and AI tokens. Analysts credit the rebound to growing belief that digital assets could act as a safe-haven alternative amid trade instability. \u201cWhenever traditional markets shake, crypto finds strength in decentralization,\u201d said market analyst & Experts. \u201cInvestors are buying the dip across high-potential projects \u2013 especially those with community-driven growth.\u201d Best Crypto to Buy Right Now (October 2025 Edition) Here are five trending projects analysts are calling the best crypto to buy now amid market recovery and rising investor optimism. Based Eggman (EGG) \u2013 Meme Energy Meets Utility \ud83d\udd17 Official Site: BasedEggman.com If 2024 was the year of Dogwifhat and Pepe, 2025 might belong to Based Eggman . What started as a light-hearted meme project has evolved into a full-scale ecosystem blending Gaming & NFT rewards , staking pools , and a community-driven DAO . Why It\u2019s Trending: Thousands of viral mentions across X (Twitter) and Telegram. Egg NFTs provide real staking utility and community governance rights. Active presale phase with a growing number of holders. Analyst Take: Based Eggman\u2019s meme + utility blend makes it the most talked-about new crypto this week. Its humor-driven narrative is pulling the same viral energy that powered early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rallies \u2014 but with smarter tokenomics. ChainGPT (CGPT) \u2013 AI Crypto for Smart Investors Artificial intelligence remains one of the hottest narratives of 2025. ChainGPT continues to lead the AI crypto presale and infrastructure segment, offering decentralized AI tools for developers and traders. Highlights: Built-in AI trading bots for portfolio management. Increasing partnerships with DeFi protocols. Growing retail adoption after exchange listings. Market Insight: As AI becomes a mainstream investment theme, ChainGPT could become one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth , combining cutting-edge tech with proven demand. Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 The Comeback King Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin remains the top choice for stability in uncertain times. The \u201cTrump-China trade war 2.0\u201d fears actually strengthened Bitcoin\u2019s role as digital gold , with institutional buying increasing post-sanction announcement. Latest Price: $59,200 (up 3.2% in 24 hours) YTD Return: +67% Analyst View: If geopolitical tensions continue, Bitcoin could easily retest $70,000 by year-end. For risk-averse investors, BTC remains the best crypto to buy for capital preservation . Solana (SOL) \u2013 Powering the Next Wave of DApps Solana continues to be the fastest-growing layer-1 blockchain with record developer activity and rising on-chain volumes . Despite minor corrections, SOL remains a strong mid-term pick. Why It\u2019s Bullish: Over 40% of new meme and gaming projects launching on Solana. Lower gas fees attracting DeFi builders. Institutional partnerships in the pipeline. Analyst Call: With network stability improving, Solana is one of the best crypto assets to buy on dips , potentially hitting $250 during the next altseason. Polygon (MATIC) \u2013 India\u2019s Web3 Powerhouse With new integrations in gaming, NFTs, and corporate Web3 adoption, Polygon remains one of the most trusted Ethereum scaling solutions. Why It\u2019s a Solid Buy: Active collaborations with major brands and government projects. Consistent burn mechanism reducing supply. High staking yield opportunities. Expert\u2019s Take: As India pushes for blockchain adoption, MATIC could become the go-to infrastructure token for global Web3 developers. Investor Sentiment: Dip-Buying Returns Google Trends data shows a 120% surge in searches for \u201cbest crypto to buy now\u201d since Trump\u2019s trade sanction speech \u2013 a clear indicator of renewed retail curiosity.

Summary CME Group officially launched options trading for Solana and XRP Trading in two altcoins will fall under U.S. CFTC regulation The move broadens institutional access for SOL and XRP Institutional demand for major altcoins is growing. On Monday, Oct. 13, CME Group, the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchange, officially launched options for Solana and XRP, fully regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Trading for Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) options is now live , giving institutional investors access to fully regulated derivatives on two of the most traded altcoins. The options are physically settled, available in both standard and micro sizes, and have daily, monthly, and quarterly expirations. This means traders can now trade these altcoin options on the CME exchange in the same way they trade Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Until now, only SOL and XRP futures were available on the exchange. You might also like: Solana, XRP first in line as SEC fast-tracks altcoin ETFs Solana and XRP futures see strong volume The move comes after CME obtained regulatory approval from the CFTC, and after Solana and XRP futures already amassed significant trading volume. This liquidity contributed to CME\u2019s decision to expand investor access. What\u2019s more, with the addition of options trading, activity for the two altcoins will likely increase. In particular, since the launch of Solana futures in March, the platform facilitated trading of more than 540,000 contracts, with a notional value of $22.3 billion by September. On the other hand, there were 370,000 XRP contracts traded since May, with a notional value of $16.2 billion. Blue-chip altcoins were among the first to bounce back after the $1 trillion crypto market wipeout. While CME announced expanding its options trading in September, it still signals growing institutional interest in these altcoins.

Read 's Market Analysis on Investing.com", "published_at": "2025-10-13T20:22:14Z", "source": "Investing.com", "content": "Much has changed in Ethereum\u2019s price (ETHUSD) since our last public update four weeks ago, see here , when we anticipated a quicker rally to $6000+. Instead, Ether experienced a notable detour over the past four weeks, including a sudden spike on Friday, but the overall outlook remains unchanged, see Figure 1 below. Specifically, our preferred long-term Elliott Wave Principle (EW) analysis suggests that ETHUSD is in the final upward impulse from its April 2025 low: the black Wave-5. Since impulses move in five waves (red W-i, ii, iii, iv, v) and only four have occurred so far, at least one more wave (red W-v) is needed. The ideal target zone for W-v is $6921 to $9159. Figure 1. Our preferred long-term EW count for Ethereum.  In this case, we count down months since the April black W-4 low as the 2nd and 4th waves of the black W-5: red W-ii and W-iv, respectively. Additionally, at last week\u2019s low, Ether retested the breakout from the bull flag pattern it remained in for most of 2022-24. This is a classic technical pattern. From this perspective, the bull flag target of $6141 remains unmet, given the recent $4955 ATH on August 24. So, what happened last week? (Flash) Crashes are most often C-waves. Last Friday was no different, and our adjusted short-term EW count indicates the flash crash most likely completed the green W-c of the red W-iv. In this case, the 4th wave became protracted rather than simple, as shown in our last update, evolving into a seven-week-long expanded flat. See Figure 2 below. Figure 2. Our preferred short-term EW count for Ethereum. The 11-day rally that peaked at the October 7 high of $4758 consisted of seven waves and was therefore a corrective B-wave, as those typically move in 3, 7, 11, etc., steps, while impulses move in 5, 9, 11, etc., steps. Additionally, although the red W-iii topped beyond the typical 161.8% Fibonacci extension, Ether bottomed out right at the 100.0% Fib extension at Friday\u2019s low, which is a common 4th wave target. Therefore, as long as it remains above last Friday\u2019s $3546 low, we can expect Ether to still reach over $6000 and possibly as high as $9000 in the coming weeks and months.

It is a fictional representation created for illustrative purposes only. SHARE The U.S. dollar gained ground against the euro and yen on Monday, buoyed by a shift in rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump. Following aggressive tariff threats, Trump's softer tone lowered trade tension anxieties, contributing to the dollar's recovery across international markets. The dollar index, which monitors the U.S. currency against major peers, rose 0.2% to 99.25. Analysts believe the dollar remains a primary safe haven amid global currency developments. The potential de-escalation of trade conflicts may affect Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions in the upcoming months. European and Asian markets had mixed responses to international and domestic political events. Meanwhile, in the cryptocurrency sector, a turbulent week of liquidations reversed slightly on Monday, with minor gains across key digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Reputable investors call it \u201cdigital gold,\u201d and some even claim it\u2019s better than gold. Notwithstanding all these, Bitcoin is still facing various security threats. Lately, a lot has been said about the potential threat from quantum computers. However, Duke University Professor Campbell Harvey revealed another concern, namely the relative cheapness of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network. Summary If successful, a 51% attack gives attackers control over the Bitcoin blockchain (or another proof-of-work-based blockchain). To achieve success, attackers must control over 50% of the mining hashrate, which is costly. In the past, Bitcoin Gold and Ethereum Classic went through successful 51% attacks, resulting in the theft of coins through double-spending. Throughout history, the Bitcoin blockchain has been safe from the 51% attacks. According to Harvey, to dominate in the hashrate production for one week, attackers would need to spend \u201conly\u201d $6 billion, which is less than 0.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization. Harvey provided a possible practical use of such an attack. Duke University Fuqua School of Business Professor Campbell Harvey released a paper dedicated to potential threats to Bitcoin . In an abstract , Harvey likens Bitcoin to gold but outlines that Bitcoin is facing its specific threats: quantum computers and, what\u2019s more important, a possible 51% attack. He also recognizes that Bitcoin has its advantages over gold. For instance, he mentions that \u201cmodern alchemy\u201d allows the production of more gold, while Bitcoin\u2019s supply cannot exceed 21,000,000 units. Read more: Quantum Countdown: How Bitcoin\u2019s 15-year shield faces its biggest threat yet What\u2019s a 51% attack? As Bitcoin mining is costly and requires special hardware, miners don\u2019t have an opportunity to mess with the ledger data. Each node \u201cvotes\u201d via computing power (hashrate) to validate transactions in new blocks, and the majority of miners are voting for correct data. Miners are motivated to vote for the correct data as they depend on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s integrity, which gives it value. However, once half of the total hashrate in the system is controlled by a single entity (a person or a group of plotters), it has the power to change the records in the Bitcoin ledger. It will allow bad actors to move other people\u2019s bitcoins, effectively stealing them. While some criticize Bitcoin for its low decentralization level, no one in 16 years of Bitcoin\u2019s existence has ever managed to gain control over the Bitcoin blockchain. In the early days of Bitcoin, mining was accessible to any PC owner. However, as mining is based on competition where the luckiest miner has to have a higher hashrate level than most rivals, computers and even GPUs and FPGAs quickly became obsolete for mining. In 2013, the first ASICs (devices specialized for Bitcoin mining) hit the market. Soon, Bitcoin mining turned into a multi-million-dollar industry, requiring much investment and facilities filled with humming ASIC devices. In October 2025, Bitcoin mining difficulty reached a new maximum. Bitcoin mining difficulty just adjusted: +5.97% to 150T (new ATH). Good thing price is pumping to offset the hashprice squeeze. pic.twitter.com/3qrdKirgnR \u2014 Javier Hermosa (@JavierHermosa21) October 2, 2025 It makes hacking Bitcoin via a 51% attack a hard and expensive task. As the mining difficulty is going up, each year the costs of a 51% attack are getting higher. Campbell Harvey\u2019s findings While a 51% attack is costly, its price is not unthinkable. Such networks as Bitcoin Gold and Ethereum Classic suffered several 51% attacks after 2017. Each one of them resulted in one million plus worth of crypto stolen in each separate case. In August 2025, Qubic mining pool claimed it got over 50% of the hashing power in the Monero network. Read more: Monero in trouble: Kraken freezes deposits, Qubic grabs 51% hashrate Professor Harvey calculated the costs and concluded that one week of domination on the Bitcoin blockchain would cost \u201conly\u201d $6 billion: \u201cHardware is the largest expenditure, about $4.6 billion at current prices. The data center build would require $1.34 billion and the electricity to run the hardware and maintain the data center about $0.13 billion per week. All told, a one-week attack would cost about $6 billion, or 0.26% of the bitcoin network\u2019s total value.\u201d The research is based on the following metrics: Bitcoin\u2019s annual output is 164,363 BTC Energy usage is 166.4TWh Total cost is $12 trillion Total energy cost is $8.4 trillion Total cost per unit is $73,000 per 1 BTC unit Harvey noted that a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin would cause a severe price drop, and hackers could still profit from it and earn much more than $6 billion back. Harvey estimated BTC perpetual futures daily volume at $60 billion and conventional BTC futures daily volume at $10 billion. Harvey believes that opening a short position on these markets before a 51% attack could result in high profits for attackers on top of returning $6 billion. Harvey adds that the motive may not be profit-related. However, critics of Harvey\u2019s warning argued that setting such a huge mining operation would have taken years, and it wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. More than that, shorting so much BTC in the conditions of an ongoing 51% attack may be hard, as the exchange will probably flag an operation as market manipulation and won\u2019t let it. Commenting on Harvey\u2019s research, Matt Prusak, president of American Bitcoin Corp., told Bloomberg: \u201cMy attitude is that economic feasibility kills the 51% thesis. I live in the real world, and I am not concerned.\u201d You might also like: Dogecoin flagged as next target by Qubic group after 51% attack on Monero", "ai_summary": "A 51% attack on the Bitcoin network could cost $6 billion, according to Duke University Professor Campbell Harvey, though it remains expensive and rare.

Top cryptocurrencies fell after US President Donald Trump imposed 100% tariffs on 'any and all critical software' from China , amid growing geopolitical tensions. Soon after, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum witnessed record liquidations as investors moved money into other safer assets. Bloomberg data revealed that over $19 billion (\u00a314.2 billion) in crypto bets were wiped out within 24 hours following Trump's announcement on his Truth Social platform. Bitcoin prices fell by over 10% to as low as $110,000 (\u00a382,466) while Ethereum fell over 11.2% on the news. Meanwhile, prices of trending cryptocurrencies like XRP and Dogecoin also declined by 19% and 27%, respectively. In tandem with one of the major crypto market crashes in recent times, a popular Ukrainian crypto investor and influencer, Konstantin Galich, supposedly took his own life inside his Lamborghini Urus in the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv. Recovered Firearm Registered Under Galich's Name Galich, who was 32 years old, was found inside his car with a gunshot wound to the head. The Kyiv Police Department confirmed in its official Telegram channel that a firearm registered under his name was also recovered at the scene. A statement shared on the Kyiv Police Department's Telegram channel said that a day before Galich's death, 'the man told relatives that he was feeling depressed due to financial difficulties and also sent them a farewell message.' The death of Galich, better known as Kostya Kudo, has shocked the crypto community. He founded the Cryptology Key trading academy and was an active influencer in digital asset markets with thousands of followers on Instagram . Trump's announcement triggered panic among crypto investors. In the major liquidation event that followed, around $400 billion (\u00a3299.8 billion) was wiped off the value of the crypto market, according to multiple media reports. JD Vance Signals More Potential Volatility Ahead US Vice President JD Vance said Trump was committed to safeguarding America's economic livelihoods while making the US more self-sufficient. He explained that China having 'so much control over critical supply in the United States of America' implies a national emergency and justifies Trump's move to slap exorbitant tariffs. 'It's going to be a delicate dance and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,' Vance recently told Fox News. 'If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People's Republic of China.' If Beijing is willing to be reasonable, Trump could be a reasonable negotiator. 'We're going to find out a lot in the weeks to come about whether China wants to start a trade war with us or whether they actually want to be reasonable,' Vance concluded. The passing away of Galich shows how the highly volatile cryptocurrency industry could wipe out entire investments. Despite mass adoption by people and corporations, the risks of massive losses from crypto investments have barely changed compared with earlier years.

Bitcoin and altcoins saw a sharp dip earlier this week as former U.S. President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Chinese imports , triggering short-term panic across commodities and risk assets. But within 48 hours, the crypto market made a remarkable recovery \u2014 signaling growing investor confidence in digital assets as a global hedge. From AI-powered tokens to community-led meme coins , traders are now shifting focus toward projects with strong fundamentals and high social momentum. Here\u2019s a look at the top trending cryptocurrencies and presales that analysts believe could outperform as the market stabilizes. Market Recap: Trump\u2019s Sanction Shock & Crypto\u2019s Swift Rebound On Monday, the Trump administration announced a new round of sanctions targeting Chinese tech and import goods , citing \u201cunfair market practices.\u201d The announcement triggered a global sell-off: The S&P 500 fell 2.4% for the period, Gold touching all time historic high , and Bitcoin briefly dropped below $110,000 before rebounding. By midweek, the crypto market cap recovered above $3.90 trillion , with strong inflows into DeFi, meme, and AI tokens. Analysts credit the rebound to growing belief that digital assets could act as a safe-haven alternative amid trade instability. \u201cWhenever traditional markets shake, crypto finds strength in decentralization,\u201d said market analyst & Experts. \u201cInvestors are buying the dip across high-potential projects \u2013 especially those with community-driven growth.\u201d Best Crypto to Buy Right Now (October 2025 Edition) Here are five trending projects analysts are calling the best crypto to buy now amid market recovery and rising investor optimism. Based Eggman (EGG) \u2013 Meme Energy Meets Utility \ud83d\udd17 Official Site: BasedEggman.com If 2024 was the year of Dogwifhat and Pepe, 2025 might belong to Based Eggman . What started as a light-hearted meme project has evolved into a full-scale ecosystem blending Gaming & NFT rewards , staking pools , and a community-driven DAO . Why It\u2019s Trending: Thousands of viral mentions across X (Twitter) and Telegram. Egg NFTs provide real staking utility and community governance rights. Active presale phase with a growing number of holders. Analyst Take: Based Eggman\u2019s meme + utility blend makes it the most talked-about new crypto this week. Its humor-driven narrative is pulling the same viral energy that powered early Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rallies \u2014 but with smarter tokenomics. ChainGPT (CGPT) \u2013 AI Crypto for Smart Investors Artificial intelligence remains one of the hottest narratives of 2025. ChainGPT continues to lead the AI crypto presale and infrastructure segment, offering decentralized AI tools for developers and traders. Highlights: Built-in AI trading bots for portfolio management. Increasing partnerships with DeFi protocols. Growing retail adoption after exchange listings. Market Insight: As AI becomes a mainstream investment theme, ChainGPT could become one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth , combining cutting-edge tech with proven demand. Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 The Comeback King Despite short-term volatility, Bitcoin remains the top choice for stability in uncertain times. The \u201cTrump-China trade war 2.0\u201d fears actually strengthened Bitcoin\u2019s role as digital gold , with institutional buying increasing post-sanction announcement. Latest Price: $59,200 (up 3.2% in 24 hours) YTD Return: +67% Analyst View: If geopolitical tensions continue, Bitcoin could easily retest $70,000 by year-end. For risk-averse investors, BTC remains the best crypto to buy for capital preservation . Solana (SOL) \u2013 Powering the Next Wave of DApps Solana continues to be the fastest-growing layer-1 blockchain with record developer activity and rising on-chain volumes . Despite minor corrections, SOL remains a strong mid-term pick. Why It\u2019s Bullish: Over 40% of new meme and gaming projects launching on Solana. Lower gas fees attracting DeFi builders. Institutional partnerships in the pipeline. Analyst Call: With network stability improving, Solana is one of the best crypto assets to buy on dips , potentially hitting $250 during the next altseason. Polygon (MATIC) \u2013 India\u2019s Web3 Powerhouse With new integrations in gaming, NFTs, and corporate Web3 adoption, Polygon remains one of the most trusted Ethereum scaling solutions. Why It\u2019s a Solid Buy: Active collaborations with major brands and government projects. Consistent burn mechanism reducing supply. High staking yield opportunities. Expert\u2019s Take: As India pushes for blockchain adoption, MATIC could become the go-to infrastructure token for global Web3 developers. Investor Sentiment: Dip-Buying Returns Google Trends data shows a 120% surge in searches for \u201cbest crypto to buy now\u201d since Trump\u2019s trade sanction speech \u2013 a clear indicator of renewed retail curiosity. Trading volume on decentralized exchanges rose 22% week-over-week, with presale tokens and meme coins driving much of the traffic. \u201cRetail money is rotating back into presales and AI tokens,\u201d says Crypto Experts. \u201cPeople see these dips as opportunities rather than panic signals.\u201d Outlook: Volatility Breeds Opportunity If the global trade tensions persist, volatility could remain high \u2013 but for crypto, volatility equals opportunity. Experts expect new capital inflows into early-stage presale crypto projects , AI ecosystems , and community coins like Based Eggman, which thrive on viral growth.

Listen 0:00 4884 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: Bitcoin\u2019s resilience after Friday\u2019s $19 billion flash crash shows long-term demand remains strong despite short-term risk aversion. Derivatives traders remain cautious, with arbitrage opportunities and negative funding rates signaling heightened counterparty risk. Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaimed the $114,000 mark less than 48 hours after Friday\u2019s flash crash, which wiped out $15 billion from BTC futures open interest. While Bitcoin showed resilience after such a major liquidity event, several factors could still delay a retest of the $125,000 level. As long as investors continue to view Bitcoin as a risk asset and maintain its partial correlation with tech stocks, sustained bullish momentum will likely hinge on stronger confidence in global economic growth. US job market, US-China relations have negative impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price Concerns about a potential economic slowdown, particularly after new signs of weakness in the US labor market, have made investors more risk-averse. Carlyle estimates that US employers added 17,000 jobs in September, down from an already soft 22,000 in August, according to The Wall Street Journal. US two-year Treasury yield. Source: TradingView Demand for US bonds surged, pushing yields close to 3.5% as investors accepted lower returns in exchange for the safety of government-backed assets. The move was further driven by growing concerns that the trade war between the United States and China could intensify on Nov. 10, when the temporary truce limiting US import tariffs is set to expire. US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday that an extension \u201cshould be worked out\u201d as both countries pursue economic growth. However, no concrete developments have been announced beyond plans for talks between the two leaders. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described China\u2019s rare earth export controls as \u201cprovocative.\u201d Under new Chinese regulations, foreign companies producing certain materials will now need an additional export license, even when Chinese companies are not directly involved. China continues to dominate these markets, which are critical to tech manufacturing, according to Reuters. Further macroeconomic uncertainty stems from the ongoing US government shutdown, which has delayed the release of key data, including the consumer inflation report and wholesale costs. This lack of visibility complicates the US Federal Reserve\u2019s outlook and has made investors more risk-averse ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Tuesday. Liquidity gaps in BTC derivatives and risk of regulatory security Regardless of the prospects for improvement in US-China relations, traders remain highly cautious with Bitcoin derivatives . Some markets still present arbitrage opportunities, such as differences between perpetual contracts and spot prices on the same exchange. The limited activity from market makers signals heightened counterparty risk. Annualized funding rate on Bitcoin and altcoins. Source: CoinGlass The Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate at Binance remains negative, meaning shorts (bearish positions) pay for leverage. Meanwhile, the indicator has returned to a normal positive range on other exchanges, creating potential arbitrage opportunities on rates. Source: X/ joemccann Joe McCann, founder and CEO of Asymmetric Financial, said on X that \u201ca very large market maker\u201d must have been wiped out during Friday\u2019s crash, which would explain the sharp price gaps across exchanges and the \u201cinsane dislocations\u201d on Binance. Even if these assumptions prove short-lived, traders will likely wait longer before re-entering the cryptocurrency market. Related: Centralized exchanges face claims of massive liquidation undercounts Other market participants sharply criticized how exchanges handled liquidation triggers and derivatives pricing. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek urged regulators to \u201cconduct a thorough review of the fairness of practices,\u201d pointing to downtimes affecting only certain users and the absence of compliance measures on \u201cinternal trading.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s unique qualities, which allow it to potentially benefit from rising demand for independent scarce assets, were not affected by Friday\u2019s flash crash. However, traders\u2019 short-term risk appetite has clearly diminished, which could delay the journey to a new all-time high by several weeks or months.

Listen 0:00 2908 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Garrett Jin, former CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange BitForex, has denied multiple allegations from a pseudonymous online investigator accusing him of market shorting. In a Monday X post, Jin said he had \u201cno connection with the Trump family,\u201d denying allegations of insider trading after crypto researcher Eye claimed he controlled a wallet address used by a whale to short Bitcoin ( BTC ). The wallet was used to open a short position less than an hour before US President Donald Trump announced \u201ca tariff of 100% on China\u201d on Friday, likely contributing to the price of the cryptocurrency dropping significantly. On Saturday, Eye suggested on X that Jin was a Hyperliquid whale who controlled more than 100,000 BTC. In his response, Jin said the wallet belonged to a client and criticized former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for sharing \u201cpersonal and private information\u201d by retweeting Eye\u2019s post to his more than 10 million followers. Whether tied directly to Jin or not, the wallet address was used to open a $735 million short on BTC. The price of Bitcoin briefly fell to about $102,000 on Friday after the tariff notice, though the president said in a Sunday social media post, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about China,\u201d walking back some of his remarks. Related: Bitcoin plummets to $102K on Binance as Trump announces 100% tariffs on China Despite the alleged connections between Jin and the now infamous Bitcoin wallet, some online sleuths doubt Eye\u2019s claims. ZachXBT said on Saturday it was more likely that \u201ca friend of Jin\u201d was responsible for the trades, while crypto analyst Quinten Francois suggested the evidence linking the former CEO to the wallet was too convenient. Insider trading allegations are nothing new in crypto Many individuals in the crypto exchange have previously been accused of having private information about a project launch following suspiciously timed trades. In March, an unknown individual or group made more than $482,000 through trades on the Bubb (BUBB) memecoin shortly before the price dropped by about 50%. Trump\u2019s memecoin, Official Trump ( TRUMP ), drew similar attention in January after a wallet purchased about $6 million of the token less than a minute after its launch.

The firm, formerly known as MicroStrategy Inc. has long been considered a bellwether for crypto sentiment, as it grew to become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. But as skepticism over the crypto treasury model rose, Strategy\u2019s stock price has lagged behind Bitcoin as it rallied to a record price of $126,000 this month. The Virginia-based firm announced a purchase of an additional 220 Bitcoin in a press release on Monday at an average price of $123,561 per coin, for a total $27 million investment, the highest price Strategy has ever paid per Bitcoin. That\u2019s its fourth smallest Bitcoin acquisition since last October and its seventh smallest on record, according to company data. The latest purchase raises Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings to a total of 640,250 Bitcoin, which represents 3% of the nearly 20 million total Bitcoin token in circulation. Its holdings are 12 times those of the next largest holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Strategy\u2019s stock was up 3.5% in Monday trading, and has risen by 8.9% year-to-date. Recent data suggests that the crypto treasury model is losing steam, not just in its performance, but also through the slowing pace of Bitcoin buying by treasury firms. Yet, Strategy has an advantage over its competitors through a focus on Bitcoin-linked fixed income instruments, according to Benchmark Equity Research analyst Mark Palmer. The company has billed its perpetual preferred stock offerings as a way for Strategy to keep buying Bitcoin without diluting shareholders. In this structure, dividends are paid at a variable rate, providing lenders the flexibility to ride out cryptocurrency cycles, notes Palmer. This, in turn, offers Saylor with fresh cash to continue purchasing the token without weakening shareholder value through a stream of share issuances. The company\u2019s financing tactics, however, have also drawn criticism after a recent preferred stock sale drew tepid demand, forcing Strategy to issue common shares to make up for the shortfall. Strategy\u2019s stock got a boost after recent tax legislation that allows it to exclude unrealized gains on holdings of digital assets when calculating corporate tax liabilities. The firm reported an unrealized gain of $3.89 billion on its digital asset holdings for the quarter ending September 30. The new tax rule removes a \u201csignificant source\u201d of potential overhang for Strategy, according to TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza, while it also represents \u201ca key point of Bitcoin integration into global financial systems.\u201d More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com \u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.
